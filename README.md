# Demonlist+ Extension

Due to the severe inactivity of the demonlist developers on the front-end side, I've decided to create an extension which enhances your experience on the website with features such as:
- Personalized Demonlist view
- Customizable color palette
- Dark mode!
- Loading legacy levels
- Sorted stats viewer
- List points calculator
- QOL fixes
