# Demonlist+ Extension

Due to the severe inactivity of the demonlist developers on the front-end, I've decided to create an extension which enhances your experience on the website with features such as:
- Personalized website view, which includes showing logged in name and your list point count
- Personalized /demonlist view - highlighted levels with progress, calculated list points and viewed list%
- Your own video submissions replacing showcases on /demonlist for accessibility purposes
- Preview of other players' demonlist via the manual playerID selection
- Customizable color palette
- Quickly accessible list points calculator
- Quality of Life fixes (prettier footer)
- and many more! With upcoming features such as dark mode, legacy loading and custom list creation in the future updates of the extension.

<!-- Compatible with all browsers (Firefox and Chromium based) -->
